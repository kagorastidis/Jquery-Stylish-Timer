# Jquery-Stylish-Timer

This is a simple timer that counts seconds-mins-hours.

It is based on <a href="https://github.com/jylauril/jquery-runner" target="_blank"> jquery-runner by Jyrki Laurila</a>.

Icons for the play-pause button were taken from <a href="https://www.google.com/design/icons/" target="_blank"> google material icons.</a>

Design Idea came from <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2334737-Countdown-Timer-PSD" target="_blank"> this dribble PSD</a>.

Use it however you like, I made it for educational purposes.
